<HTML><BODY><p>This time a book on Tibet (and neighbouring Nepal) without Tibetan or other complex scripts, and even without any unusual diacrtics, so also interesting for those who don't want to venture into the category of hard books. The text is ofcourse by a British colonial administrator and explorer, and thus represents opinions considered okay at the time, but probably not-okay today.</p>
<p>Besides the text, the book is filled with no less than 75 full-colour paintings, which make it very attractive. These are not included in the proofing pages, nor are the semi-transparant pages separating them from the text, which would basically add a couple of hundred useless pages to the project. I will take care all illustrations are included in the final HTML version.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p></BODY></HTML>
